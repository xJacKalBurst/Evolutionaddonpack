	 EAP <-> CAP Compatibility Bridge - Server-side targeted patches
	===========================================================================
	This file is the ONLY place where EAP reaches into a handful of CAP's own
	tools/weapons/entities to patch them in memory, AFTER they have already
	been registered by CAP itself. It never edits a CAP file on disk, and it
	never runs at all unless CAP is detected (Lib.IsCapDetected) - with CAP
	absent, every function below either isn't called or is a silent no-op.

	Four different, narrowly-scoped techniques are used here, all cheaper
	than a global GetClass() override (rejected earlier for this project -
	see shared/init.lua's header):

	1. Per-call GetClass() spoofing (EAP.Compat.WithSpoofedClass)
	   A handful of CAP stools/weapons decide what to do by comparing
	   t.Entity:GetClass() (or a traced entity's GetClass()) against a CAP
	   literal such as "stargate_universe" or "stargate_orlin". We wrap just
	   that one call (one LeftClick, one SpawnProp) so the entity reports its
	   CAP-equivalent class ONLY for the duration of that single call, then
	   restores its real GetClass immediately after. The entity's class is
	   never actually changed, and nothing else observing it during that
	   frame is affected. The exact same technique is also applied in the
	   OTHER direction (section 4b): several of EAP's OWN stools gate on an
	   EAP class literal the same way, so they get the mirrored spoof too
	   (CAP entity -> reports its EAP-equivalent class for that one call).

	2. Static data-table extension (EAP.Compat.ExtendArrayField / ExtendMapField)
	   A couple of CAP entities keep a plain Lua list/map of "classes I
	   recognize" as instance data (ENT.GateList, ENT.ValidGates, etc). These
	   aren't functions, so there's nothing to wrap - we just add the EAP
	   equivalents directly into that same table once, after CAP registers
	   it, via scripted_ents.GetStored(class).t.

	3. Function replacement (EAP.Compat.PatchRampGateFinder)
	   The CAP ramp entities' GateFinder() method uses a hand-rolled pattern
	   match (v:GetClass():find("stargate_*")) that only ever matches CAP's
	   own "stargate_..." classes. We replace that one method (same
	   scripted_ents.GetStored(class).t mechanism) with an equivalent version
	   that also recognizes EAP's "sg_..." classes, keeping every other
	   behavior of the entity untouched.

	4. Scripting-backend registry merges (section 6 below)
	   EAP's and CAP's E2/ExpAdv2/Wire-gate/Starfall stargate extension
	   files live at the same path in both addons, so only one of them ever
	   actually loads - the other is fully shadowed, not just overridden
	   function-by-function. For the one function in all four that breaks
	   because of this (stargateGetRingAngle), we reach into whichever
	   backend's own registry ends up holding it (wire_expression2_funcs,
	   GateActions, the ExpAdv2 "stargate" component, Starfall's
	   SF.Entities.Methods) and overwrite that one entry with a version
	   that recognizes both class families - same "patch the registry after
	   the fact" principle as the other three techniques, just applied to a
	   table slot instead of a Lua method.

	Known, accepted limitation: a few places inside CAP's own Think()/logic
	compare an entity's class directly in-line against a CAP literal in a way
	that can't be patched by any of the three techniques above without
	reimplementing that function's full body (e.g. gate_nuke's supergate
	shutdown branch: `elseif class == "stargate_supergate" then`). Those are
	left as-is: they simply won't trigger for an EAP supergate caught in a
	CAP gate_nuke's blast radius. This is a deliberate trade-off to avoid
	duplicating CAP's internal logic inside this bridge.

-- ===========================================================================
-- 1. Per-call GetClass() spoofing helper
-- ===========================================================================

-- IMPORTANT: a per-instance assignment (`ent.GetClass = function() ... end`)
-- has ZERO effect in GMod - `Entity:GetClass()` is resolved through the
-- shared Entity metatable at the engine level, not through per-instance Lua
-- table storage the way an ordinary custom field (`ent.Foo = 123`) is. This
-- was confirmed empirically (diagnostic logging showed ent:GetClass() still
-- returning the real class immediately after the per-instance assignment),
-- and is why every tool/weapon patch in this file that relies on this
-- helper previously had no effect in-game despite installing with no
-- warnings.
--
-- The fix has to replace the function slot on the METATABLE itself
-- (FindMetaTable("Entity").GetClass), which is what :GetClass() actually
-- resolves through for every entity. To keep this as narrowly-scoped as
-- the global override already rejected for this project (see this file's
-- header), the replacement:
--   - only returns the spoofed class for the ONE entity passed in (an
--     identity check - `self == ent`), every other entity's GetClass() is
--     untouched and goes straight to the previous implementation;
--   - is installed and removed strictly around the single synchronous
--     pcall(fn, ...) below (one LeftClick, one SpawnProp) - there is no
--     ongoing per-frame cost, unlike a persistent hook;
--   - saves and restores whatever was on the metatable slot at entry/exit
--     (`previousGetClass`), rather than assuming it's always the engine's
--     own original function. This makes nested/re-entrant calls (e.g. one
--     spoofed LeftClick that itself triggers another spoofed call before
--     returning - same entity or a different one) resolve correctly: each
--     call's wrapper falls back to exactly what was installed before it,
--     so unwinding always peels back to the right layer instead of two
--     nested calls clobbering a single shared "real function" variable.
function EAP.Compat.WithSpoofedClass(ent, spoofedClass, fn, ...)
	if (not IsValid(ent)) then return fn(...) end

	local entMeta = FindMetaTable("Entity");
	local previousGetClass = entMeta.GetClass;

	entMeta.GetClass = function(self)
		if (self == ent) then return spoofedClass end
		return previousGetClass(self);
	end

	local results = { pcall(fn, ...) };

	entMeta.GetClass = previousGetClass;

	if (not results[1]) then
		error(results[2], 0);
	end

	return unpack(results, 2);
end

-- Same call-scoped Entity-metatable technique, generalized: some of EAP's
-- and CAP's own dialing functions (FindGate's Atlantis tie-break,
-- WormHoleJump's Orlin/Supergate checks, the DHD's PressButton) don't test
-- ONE already-known entity against ONE literal - they run their own
-- internal ents.FindByClass() loop and GetClass()-compare MANY candidate
-- entities at once. WithSpoofedClass doesn't fit that shape (it only knows
-- about a single `ent`), so this version instead spoofs by CLASS: any
-- entity whose real class is a key in `classMap` reports the mapped value
-- instead, for the duration of fn(...). Passing the bridge's own
-- CapToEap/EapToCap maps (already built in compatibility/shared/init.lua)
-- means every gate-type pair this bridge has ever been told about is
-- covered automatically, including stargate types no section of this file
-- had to special-case by hand. Same cost/safety profile as WithSpoofedClass
-- (temporary, call-scoped, synchronous, nested-safe save/restore) - see
-- that function's header comment for the full risk discussion.

-- ===========================================================================
-- 3. Ramp GateFinder() replacement
-- ===========================================================================
-- Same behavior as CAP's own GateFinder (self.Gate = the last matching gate
-- found among constrained ents), just matching "sg_..." in addition to
-- "stargate_...". `excludeClass`, when given, is skipped exactly like CAP's
-- own ramp_2 skips "stargate_dhd" (there is no EAP equivalent to exclude).

local function IsBridgedGateClass(class, excludeClass)
	if (excludeClass and class == excludeClass) then return false end
	return class:find("stargate") ~= nil or class:find("^sg_") ~= nil;
end

				self.Gate = v;
			end
		end
	end
end

-- ===========================================================================
-- 4. CAP stool LeftClick patch (uses the spoofing helper from section 1)
-- ===========================================================================
-- Covers every CAP stool confirmed to gate its LeftClick behavior on
-- t.Entity:GetClass() matching a CAP gate literal: bearing, floorchevron
-- (both check for "stargate_universe"), goauld_iris and stargate_iris (both
-- exclude "stargate_orlin" - without this patch, an EAP Orlin gate is NOT
-- excluded, which is a minor permissiveness bug this patch also fixes), and
-- supergate_dhd (checks for "stargate_supergate"). stargate_dhd.lua was
-- checked and does NOT need this (its LeftClick doesn't compare classes).

local SPOOFED_TOOLS = { "bearing", "floorchevron", "goauld_iris", "stargate_iris", "supergate_dhd" };

-- Shared by both directions (section 4 and 4b below), and also by the
-- InitializeTools/existing-weapon re-patching in section 4c: wraps a given
-- TOOL object's LeftClick (whichever table it lives in - the class-level
-- template, or a per-weapon-instance copy) using the given class map.

		return;

	WrapToolLeftClickObj(stored.Tool[toolname], EAP_TO_CAP);
end

-- ===========================================================================
-- 4b. EAP stool LeftClick patch (mirror of section 4, other direction)
-- ===========================================================================
-- Section 4 above only covers CAP's OWN stools gating on a CAP class
-- literal. EAP ships several of its own stools that independently gate on
-- an EAP class literal the exact same way - these were never patched
-- before, which is why e.g. EAP's own "gatebearing" tool refuses an EAP
-- Universe gate's CAP counterpart with its "not a Universe stargate" error
-- (t.Entity:GetClass():find("sg_universe") - confirmed in
-- weapons/gmod_tool/stools/gatebearing.lua). Exact same spoofing
-- technique, just mirrored: CAP_TO_EAP instead of EAP_TO_CAP, and EAP's own
-- tool names instead of CAP's.
--
-- Confirmed by grepping every EAP stool under weapons/gmod_tool/stools/:
--   - gatebearing, floor_chevron: hard-require the target class to contain
--     "sg_universe" - blocking bug, fixed by this patch.
--   - supergatedhd: hard-require the target class to equal "sg_supergate"
--     exactly - blocking bug, fixed by this patch.
--   - goauldiris, iris_sgc, iris_atlantis, iris_infinity: accept any
--     t.Entity.IsStargate (already addon-agnostic - CAP entities set that
--     flag too), but exclude only the literal "sg_orlin" - without this
--     patch, a CAP Orlin gate (stargate_orlin) is NOT excluded, mirroring
--     the same minor permissiveness bug section 4's comment already
--     documents for CAP's own iris tools. Included here for parity.
--   - stargatedhd: no gate-class literal at all - already addon-agnostic,
--     nothing to patch.

local SPOOFED_EAP_TOOLS = {
	"gatebearing", "floor_chevron", "supergatedhd",
	"goauldiris", "iris_sgc", "iris_atlantis", "iris_infinity",

	local stored = weapons.GetStored("gmod_tool");

		return;
	end
	WrapToolLeftClickObj(stored.Tool[toolname], CAP_TO_EAP);
end

-- ===========================================================================
-- 4c. Re-patch on InitializeTools + sweep existing toolguns
-- ===========================================================================
-- Sections 4 and 4b above only patch the CLASS-LEVEL template stored at
-- weapons.GetStored("gmod_tool").Tool[toolname]. That template is NOT what
-- LeftClick actually runs on at click time: Facepunch's own
-- gmod_tool/shared.lua SWEP:InitializeTools() - called every time a player
-- is given/re-equips the tool gun - does
--     temp[k] = table.Copy(v); ... self.Tool = temp
-- i.e. makes a FRESH per-weapon-instance COPY of every entry in the
-- class-level template, once, at that moment, and from then on LeftClick is
-- called on that per-instance copy, never on the template again.
--
-- table.Copy() copies a function VALUE by reference (Lua functions aren't
-- deep-cloned), so a copy made AFTER our class-level patch above still
-- points at our wrapper - fine. But a copy made BEFORE our patch (e.g. the
-- local player's tool gun, handed to them during their own spawn/loadout,
-- which can easily happen earlier than our InitPostEntity-timed install)
-- keeps the ORIGINAL, unpatched LeftClick forever for that weapon
-- instance - which is exactly why bearing/floorchevron/etc. kept failing
-- in both directions even though the template patch installed with no
-- warning. Two extra steps close this gap:
--
--   a) wrap SWEP:InitializeTools itself, so every COPY made from now on
--      (every future tool-gun pickup/respawn) gets re-wrapped right after
--      the copy is made, regardless of whether the template was patched
--      in time;
--   b) immediately sweep every "gmod_tool" weapon entity that already
--      exists right now (e.g. already in a player's hands) and re-wrap its
--      current per-instance copy directly, so weapons handed out before
--      this file ran are fixed retroactively too.

-- ===========================================================================
-- 6. Scripting-backend function merges (E2 / ExpAdv2 / Wire gates / Starfall)
-- ===========================================================================
-- EAP's and CAP's own extension files for these 4 scripting backends
-- (lua/entities/gmod_wire_expression2/core/custom/stargate.lua,
-- lua/expadv/components/custom/stargate.lua, lua/wire/gates/stargate.lua,
-- lua/starfall/libs_sv/stargate.lua) live at the EXACT SAME path in both
-- addons. Garry's Mod's virtual filesystem only exposes ONE file per
-- addon-relative path across every mounted addon - whichever addon wins
-- the mount-order priority is the only one that ever actually runs; the
-- other addon's identically-named file is fully invisible and never
-- executes at all. This is NOT a "last one registered wins" clash (which
-- would already be a pointer we could wrap, like ents.FindByClass) - it's
-- a full file-level shadow, so there is nothing of the losing addon's to
-- wrap directly.
--
-- Both files are near-identical (EAP's is historically a fork of CAP's),
-- and grepping both confirms only ONE function in all four actually
-- hard-codes a literal class whitelist: stargateGetRingAngle() (entity +
-- wirelink variants, x1 for the Wire gate node). Every other function only
-- checks the addon-agnostic `this.IsStargate` flag, so it keeps working no
-- matter which file wins the shadow.
--
-- The fix stays true to the same principle as the ents.FindByClass wrap in
-- shared/init.lua: reach into whichever registry each backend keeps its
-- registered functions in, AFTER it has been populated (InitPostEntity,
-- same as the rest of this file), and overwrite just that one entry with a
-- version that recognizes both class families - entirely from this file,
-- no new file added anywhere in CAP's, Wire's, ExpAdv2's or Starfall's own

-- 7. Dialing-UI address-list bridge (cross-addon net messages)
-- ===========================================================================
-- Each addon's dial/computer/DHD menu (lua/.../vgui/stargatemenus.lua) keeps
-- its OWN private client-side table of known gates (a local upvalue, not a
-- global - not reachable from here), populated only by listening for its
-- OWN net messages. A gate's ENT:SendGateInfo()/ENT:RefreshGateList() (one
-- call per field: address, group, name, private, blocked, locale, galaxy,
-- class, pos) broadcasts those net messages - but EAP and CAP picked
-- DIFFERENT net-string names for the exact same mechanism:
--   EAP: "RefreshGatesList" / "RemoveGatesFromList" / "RemoveGatesList"
--   CAP: "RefreshGateList"  / "RemoveGateFromList"   / "RemoveGateList"
-- (names, payload layout - EntIndex/Class/IsGroupStargate/field/type/value -
-- and call sites confirmed identical in both addons' sg_base/stargate_base
-- modules/lib.lua and server/spawner.lua). So a CAP gate's broadcast is
-- never heard by EAP's client code (wrong net-string name) and vice versa:
-- the FindByClass bridge (shared/init.lua) already made each addon's code
-- SEE the other's gates, but this networking layer is a second, separate
-- hop that bridge never touched, which is why no address from the other
-- addon ever reaches either side's dial UI.
--
-- Since the wire format is identical, the fix doesn't need to touch either
-- vgui file (would mean editing EAP's own non-compatibility code, and we
-- have no legal access to CAP's client table anyway): we wrap each addon's
-- ENT:RefreshGateList/ENT:RemoveGateFromList to ALSO re-send the exact same
-- payload under the OTHER addon's net-string name, right after the real
-- call. Both addons already register all four net-strings themselves
-- (util.AddNetworkString, called unconditionally by each addon's own
-- lib.lua) whenever they're both loaded, so there's nothing new to
-- register here.

-- sg_base and stargate_base are near-line-for-line forks of the same
-- original code: the core dial/link/open sequence (FindGate locating the
-- target entity, self.Target <-> target.Target, ActivateStargate, the
-- event horizon) works cross-addon already - plain Lua field writes and
-- identically-named methods, nothing to patch. What's left are a handful
-- of places where that shared code asks "is THIS CANDIDATE GATE a
-- supergate/Orlin/Atlantis/etc." by comparing GetClass() to ONE addon's
-- own literal, so a candidate from the OTHER addon silently fails the
-- check:
--   - GetAllGates() (modules/lib.lua): supergates get sorted into the
--     wrong bucket during address resolution if the candidate is the
--     other addon's supergate class. Fixed by reimplementing this one
--     (short, simple) using the already-correct .IsSupergate flag instead
--     of a class-literal compare - true in both addons for their own
--     supergate type (sg_supergate/shared.lua, stargate_supergate/shared.lua).
--   - WormHoleJump() (modules/lib.lua): Orlin exclusion and supergate
--     light-up/sequence choice, when the jump TARGET is the other addon's
--     gate.
--   - FindGate()/FindGateGalaxy() (modules/lib.lua): the "prefer an
--     Atlantis gate among several address matches" tie-break, when one of
--     the matches is the other addon's Atlantis gate.
--   - PressButton() (dhdbase/dhd_base init.lua): random-dial's Universe
--     guard, the Orlin-already-open guard, and the ring-rotation visual
--     sync, all keyed off the DHD's currently locked gate's class.
-- These last three are large, complex functions - reimplementing them
-- here would freeze a copy that stops tracking future EAP/CAP updates
-- (the same "loses dynamism" trade-off discussed for the stools earlier
-- in this project). Instead we wrap just their entry point with
-- WithSpoofedClassFamilies (section 1): for the duration of the real
-- call, every candidate entity of a class the bridge already knows about
-- reports its opposite-addon equivalent class, so the real function's own
-- GetClass()==literal checks inside just work, unmodified and uncopied.

-- 9. Cross-addon slow-dial synchronisation (action-timer pause routing)
-- ===========================================================================
-- Slow dialing started from the dialing UI (gate/DHD menu) makes the SOURCE
-- gate's own dial sequence pause, then resume, the DESTINATION gate's
-- pending "open" sequence so both event horizons open together:
--
--     action:Add({ f = self.PauseActions, v = { t, false, true }, d = 0 })
--     ...
--     action:Add({ f = self.PauseActions, v = { t, true,  true }, d = 0 })
--
-- Note what that really is: the SOURCE gate's PauseActions *function*,
-- called with the DESTINATION gate (t) as its "self". PauseActions finds
-- the timers to (un)pause by name, and that name is built from an
-- addon-specific prefix hard-coded in the function ("StarGate_<idx>_<n>"
-- in CAP, "Lib_<idx>_<n>" in EAP - the same prefix RunActions/StopActions
-- use to create/remove them). Between two gates of the SAME addon this is
-- harmless; across addons the source looks for timers named with ITS OWN
-- prefix, finds none of the destination's (named with the other prefix),
-- and silently pauses nothing - so the destination just runs its
-- "inbound slow dial" sequence unpaused and opens (event horizon)
-- immediately, while the source is still dialing chevron by chevron.
-- Dialing from a DHD button by button never goes through that pause
-- (nothing is pre-queued on the destination), and Atlantis/Pegasus never
-- pauses the destination - which matches what is observed in game.
--
-- Fix: route PauseActions to the function of the addon the entity being
-- (un)paused really belongs to. Both original function bodies are kept and
-- still do all the real work, so changes upstream stay picked up
-- automatically.
